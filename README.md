# First-Repo
The files that I imported into here are from the midterm assignment. It demostrates the use of tkinter, adding labels, widgets, and butttons. 
In MidtermPart1 I am asking the user to enter the number of books purchased. I have used if, elif, and else statements to show the amount of points earned per amount of books. Depending on the amount of books purchased the output will display that the user earned the amount of points corrisponding with the amount of books purchased. 
The MidtermPart1-GUI includes the part one with incorporating the GUI. I have imported creating a main window, label widgets, entry widgets, a button that computes and displays the points the user earns. It then displayed the result and the mainloop runs the whole program. 
The MidtermPart2-1 is importing tkinter, ImageTK, and pandas. This program is importing a file and image and taking that information to create labels, buttons, and display the output when clicking on each button. 
Lastly, in Midterm Part2-2 I have simply created more buttons with data to be dispslayed when clicked on each topic.
