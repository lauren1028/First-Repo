# First-Repo
The files that I imported into here are from the midterm assignment. It demostrates the use of tkinter, adding labels, widgets, and butttons. 
In MidtermPart1 I am asking the user to enter the number of books purchased. I have used if, elif, and else statements to show the amount of points earned per amount of books. Depending on the amount of books purchased the output will display that the user earned the amount of points corrisponding with the amount of books purchased.
